# Python snippets and useful scripts

**WARNING:** Mainly they are written in python3  
I try to code in python3 when it is possible.

I founded *Jupyter Notebook* very handy because it offers a readable interface while executing your Python (Julia, Scala...) code step by step.
Also, it is a good way to write code with explanations (not only comments but show results, add graphs, videos, images even $$\LaTeX$$ formulas.
Some people even write techincal books this way.

I hope you enjoyed (or learn) with these codes.
