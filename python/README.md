# Python snippets and useful scripts

**WARNING:** Mainly they are written in python3  
I try to code in python3 if it is possible.

I discovered *Jupyter Notebook* and it offers a readable interface while executing your Python code in parts.
Also, is a good way to write code and explanations. It is possible to insert formulas, graphs, images and videos.
Some people even write techincal books this way.

I hope you enjoyed (or learn) with these codes.
