# Some codes here...

Here I will upload some codes that were used...

- for teaching
- little scripts for my own use or even
- past coding interviews I made


**Notes**

1. For algorithmic challenges from ProjectEuler.net there are a repo codenamed "PE".
2. For other coding challenges maybe I'll use this repo.
